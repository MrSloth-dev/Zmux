## Instalation üì•

### Step 1: Download Zmux
Choose a directory where you want to install Zmux (e.g., `~/.local/bin`, `~/bin`, or any directory in your `$PATH`).
``` bash
# Example: Install to ~/.local/bin
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -o ~/.local/bin/zmux https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrSloth-dev/eZmux/main/zmux
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/zmux
```

### Step 2: Add to $PATH
Ensure the installation directory is in your `$PATH`. Add the following line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

``` bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin  # Replace with your chosen directory
```
Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```
### Step 3: Verify Instalation
Check if Zmux is installed correctly
```bash
zmux -v
```

## Dependencies ‚öôÔ∏è

- `tmux` version greater or equal to `v3.3`.
- `yq` version greater or equal to `v4.44.6`. This tool allows the configuration parsing.
- `fzf` This tool allows quick and interactive listing of all pre-configured and opened sessions.
- `yamllint` This tool check if configuration files are well formatted.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

Zmux is designed to be simple and intuitive. You can use it in several ways:

### List and Select Sessions

Run zmux without any arguments to open an interactive fzf window. This lists all active and pre-configured sessions.

Press Ctrl-t to toggle the preview window, which shows detailed information about the selected session, including:

 - Session status (active/inactive).

 - Configured windows and panes.

 - Layouts and commands for each pane.

### Open or Create a Specific Session

Run `zmux <session-name>` to open or create a specific session. If the session does not exist, Zmux will prompt you to create it.
 - If the session is pre-configured in your YAML files, Zmux will create the session with the specified windows, panes, and commands.

 - If the session does not exist, Zmux will create a new session with the given name.

### Export Current Session Configuration

Use the -e or --export flag to export the current session configuration to a YAML file. This is useful for saving session setups for future use.

 - Zmux will prompt you to select a configuration file or create a new one.

 - The exported configuration will include:

  - Root directory.

  - Windows and their respective panes.

  - Commands for each pane.

- Note: The export of panes in split is currently not implemented.

### Kill Session or Server

Use the `-k <session-name>` or --kill flag to kill the selected session. To kill the Tmux server and close all sessions use `-k all`

### Check Configuration Files

Use the `-c` or `--check` flag to validate your YAML configuration files with `yamllint`.
 - This ensures your configuration files are well-formatted and free of errors.

### Print Help

Use the `-h` or `--help` flag to display the help message.

### Using Split (v0.4.0+)

You can now configure splits (panes) within windows in your session configuration. Each window can have multiple panes with customizable layouts and commands.

### Example Configuration

``` yaml
sessions:
  project_a:
    root: ~/Projects/ProjectA/
    windows:
      - name: Editor
        layout: tiled  # Supported layouts: tiled, even-horizontal, even-vertical
        panes:
          - command: nvim .
          - command: htop
      - name: Server
        command: npm run dev
```
### Supported Layouts
 - `tiled` : Panes are arranged in a grid.
 - `even-horizontal `: Panel are arranged horizontally with equal width.
 - `even-vertical `: Panel are arranged horizontally with equal height.
 - `main-horizontal` : Panel are arranged horizontally with equal height but the first index, this will occupy half of the screen.
 - `main-vertical` : Panel are arranged horizontally with equal width but the first index, this will occupy half of the screen.


## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

All configurations will be sourced in `YAML` format under `~/.config/zmux/` directory.

You can have multiple sessions pre-configured in each file:
```
~/.config/zmux/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work.yaml      # Work-related sessions
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ personal.yaml  # Personal project sessions
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev.yaml       # Development environment sessions
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server.yaml    # Server management sessions
```

Example session:

``` yaml
sessions:
  project_a:
    root: ~/Projects/ProjectA/
    windows:
      - name: Editor
        layout: tiled
        panes:
          - command: nvim .
          - command: htop
      - name: Server
        command: npm run dev
```
### Key Fields üîë
- root: Root directory for the session.

- windows: List of windows.

  - name: Window name.

  - command: Command to run in the window (or pane).

  - layout: (Optional) Layout for splits. Supported: tiled, even-horizontal, even-vertical. (v0.4.0+)

  - panes: (Optional) List of panes for splits. Each pane can have a command. (v0.4.0+)

- Note: Due to how tmux commands works, I suggest to not put dots '.' in the name of windows and panes, because it leads to undefined behaviour that (currently) I cannot fix.
